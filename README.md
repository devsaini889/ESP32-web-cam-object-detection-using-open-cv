# ESP32 web cam object detection using open cv
 In this project ESP32 cam module is used to detect object using open cv
# Introduction
This project implements object detection using an ESP32-CAM module and OpenCV. The goal is to capture video feed from the ESP32 webcam and process it for real-time object detection.

# Hardware Requirements
ESP32-CAM module
ESP32-CAM MB (optional for development)
USB-to-Serial adapter (for programming)
Jumper wires
Power supply (if not using USB)
# Software Requirements
Arduino IDE
OpenCV (Python)
ESP32 board package for Arduino
# Required Python libraries:
numpy
opencv-python
